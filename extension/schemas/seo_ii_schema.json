      "question": "Mariah is performing an SEO competitive analysis on her client's website. She identifies that their backlink profile is relatively weak, primarily because her client believes backlinks are a trend and isn't interested in investing in them. However, she notices that their top competitors have received backlinks from a few reputable news agencies and aggregator sites. As a result, they are outranking her client in the SERPs. How should Mariah approach this situation with her client?",
      "answer": "Mariah should educate her client on the value provided by high-quality backlinks, then suggest a strategy of approaching the same sites which link to their competitors and ask for a similar backlink to their website.",
